# protocol-designer-to-py
A tool to convert JSON file generated by protocol designer to python script for OT-2.
# How to use
1. Create protocol using Opentrons' official Protocol Designer.
2. Export JSON file.
3. Go to the directory containing the python script, "pdjson2py.py".
4. type below:
```
$ python3 pdjson2py.py file/path/to/protocol/designer/json/file
```
5. Then the python script, "output.py" will be generated in the directory.
6. By default, the script selects tips based on the JSON file's "commands" object, which may result in unexpected order if you edit the output Python file. Use the "auto" secondary argument to remove the preassigned tip locations and automatically assign tipracks from the Protocol Designer's initial deck state to the pipettes.
```
$ python3 pdjson2py.py file/path/to/protocol/designer/json/file auto
```
# Limitations
* Most of detail parameter is not supported, and to be supported.
* Only latest API version is and will be supported, but not restricted.
* Transfer in JSON file is a combination of aspriate and dispense. The generated python file keep the structure. Same to step/cycles in thermocycler profile.
* Bug reports are welcome to improve the script.
