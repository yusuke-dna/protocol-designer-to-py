# protocol-designer-to-py
A tool to convert JSON file generated by protocol designer to python script for OT-2.
# How to use
1. Create protocol using Opentrons' official Protocol Designer.
2. Export JSON file.
3. Go to the directory containing the python script, "pdjson2py.py".
4. type below:
```
$ python3 pdjson2py.py file/path/to/protocol/designer/json/file
```
5. Then the python script, "output.py" will be generated in the directory.
6. The script picks up tip individually specified in commands object in JSON file. Optionally, you can remove tiprack assignment to default by adding secondary argument, "auto". When the option chosen, tipracks on the initial deck state, specified in the Protocol Designer will be  automatically assigned to the pipette(s) when the instruments are loaded to the protocol. 
```
$ python3 pdjson2py.py file/path/to/protocol/designer/json/file auto
```
# Limitations
* Most of detail parameter is not supported, and to be supported.
* Only latest API version is and will be supported, but not restricted.
* Transfer in JSON file is a combination of aspriate and dispense. The generated python file keep the structure. Same to step/cycles in thermocycler profile.
* Bug reports are welcome to improve the script.
